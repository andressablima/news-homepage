## Overview
This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor Challenge, that I did in a week. It was really challenging, the header button for mobile needs to be improved but I think the result is great.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I first started by structuring HTML5 with div, articles, aside and footer. And then I started the CSS custom, add color, background, images and CSS grid (that was the most challenging part, because sometimes it wouldn't work and I had to start all over, but in the end was all right.
 I started using JavaScript for the hamburguer menu, so the users can click on the icon and the menu list will open. I was stuck in this part for a bit, it worked alright but I still have to improve.
 
### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use correctly CSS Grid and Flex and how to use simple JavaSript for interactions.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on JavaScript in my next projects, because I need to learn more techniques and was the part that I struggled the most.
